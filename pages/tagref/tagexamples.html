<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is a comment, it doesn't display on the web page, we will use it to
explain the markup.

The DOCTTYPE thing above tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document,
so it can display it correctly. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, you
should always use this doctype for new documents.

It has to be the first line, that's why I'm explaining it below, from
now on I will explain each tag above its usage.
-->

<!-- The html tag is the root of an HTML document, inside of it there are
two tags: head and body. We can specify the language of the document with
the lang="en" attribute -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- The head tag contains information about the document, the content
in the head is not displayed -->
  <head>
    <!-- The meta tag is used to specify information about the document
called metadata (data about the data).

Here we specify the character set of the document, this means, how
the browser should interpret international characters like umlauts
and tildes, utf-8 is the standard for HTML documents, just add this
line in every document. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <!-- The title tag specifies the title of the page as displayed in the
title bar of the browser when selected and on the tab -->
    <title>HTML Tag Reference</title>

    <!-- The viewport metadata specifies how the page should display on
mobile devices, this is to avoid the content being too small on them. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!-- The link tag allows to load or link to other resources that are
relevant to the page, in this case we are loading two CSS files
that specify how the page should be styled, this one is the
CSS for bootstrap, which saves us from lot of manual styling.

We are loading this file from another page that's why it starts
with two slashed and the page's address -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">

    <!-- We load our own CSS file for some extra styling from the this
page, that's why it doesn't start with two slashes -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
